- What are your initial impressions of Java?
  I had initially thought Java syntax was clear and it was an interesting language. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
  I can draw conclusion that programming requires planning out functions and debugging in Python and Javaeven though the syntaxes are different.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
  What worked is that I was able to get the chatbot to follow a conversation in 2 responses as well as the printing of the transcript. What didn't work is getting the words you and me to mirror each other. I would advice that person to try to solve the problem by themselves before asking a buddy or getting tutoring hours.
